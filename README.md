# React Native Expo App Template

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It has been configured by m-riley04 to have basics set up, trimmed down from the standard default project.

The following have been set up for you:

- `prettier`
- `eslint`
- `@tanstack/react-query` (TanStack query)
- `babel`
- `.npmrc`
- `react-native-svg` and a custom icon base component
- custom `useTheme` hook
- VSCode workspace files ([`.vscode`](.vscode))

## Recommended Dev Tools

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

2. Build and start the app with:
